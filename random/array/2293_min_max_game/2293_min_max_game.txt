Problem components
    * Given an array of numbers whose length is a power of 2
    * If numbers.size() == 1 end the process
    * For every even index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
    * For every odd index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
    * Replace the array nums with newNums.
    * Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
    * Return the last number that remains in nums after applying the algorithm.
