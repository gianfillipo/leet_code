# Algorithm and Data Structure Questions
This is a place to keep track of my progress in learning algorithms and data structures. Here, I will store my solutions to various problems in C++, 
as well as notes and resources related to my learning. It is a useful tool for me to review my progress, and to monitor my progress over time. I am 
using these questions to prepare for job interviews, as mastering algorithms and data structures is essential for success in many technical roles.
